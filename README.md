# MySQL-Projects

These projects contain assignments from my File Structures and Databases (CPSC 332) course at California State University, Fullerton, as well as personal projects that I'm currently working on.

**The school assignments are:**

1. Creating and filling up a company database     

2. An Art Show Database

3. Using C++ to print records from the Database, access any record based on attribute values, and to sort a report
