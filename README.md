# MySQL-Projects

These projects contain assignments from my File Structures and Databases (CPSC 332) course at California State University, Fullerton, as well as personal projects.

The school assignments are:
Creating and filling up a company database
An Art Show Database
Using C++ to print records from the Database, access any record based on attribute values, and to sort a report
